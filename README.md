## Improved_DUN_basedFL_Aggregation

This repository is the Python implementation of the paper: titled "Improving Federated Aggregation with Deep Unfolding Networks.

## Requirements

This code is implemented in 
Python 3.9, using matplotlib and numpy.

# Training Settings



# Usage

You can directly run these python code.

1. main_env1.py: Code for setting I.
2. main_env2.py: Code for setting III containing computational capability skew. The number of epochs that can calculate during a round varies across clients.
3. main_env3.py: Code for setting IV containing communication capability skew. Each client can transmit the model parameters only with a certain probability.
